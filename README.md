# The Challenge

Using the provided API (documented in more detail below), build a small UI fulfilling the following criteria:

The UI should provide a list of notes currently in the system
The UI should list notes created within the last 6 months only by default
The UI should provide the ability to toggle the list to display all notes
The UI should provide the ability to create a new note using a modal
The UI should validate and provide feedback for the following when creating a new note:
The note itself is required
The note cannot exceed 500 characters
You do not need to build a full application shell, we're more interested in the above functionality.
